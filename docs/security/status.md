## Security Controls Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token revocation via Redis blacklist with JTI claims
- Account lockout after configurable failed login attempts
- Token blacklist with automatic TTL expiry
- SELECT FOR UPDATE on subscription mutations (prevents TOCTOU)

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker network segmentation: frontend, backend (internal), data (internal)
- PostgreSQL not exposed to host network
- CI/CD secrets via GitHub Secrets (no hardcoded values)
- Pinned CI/CD action versions (Trivy @0.28.0)

### Application Security
- Security headers on Next.js dashboard (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- CORS restricted to configured origins (no wildcards)
- Path traversal prevention with realpath validation
- HTTP → HTTPS for all external API calls
- Circuit breaker for OpenAI API resilience
- Specific exception handling (no bare except clauses)

### Monitoring & Operations
- Prometheus alert rules for service health, infrastructure, database, security
- PostgreSQL backup script with optional GPG encryption and S3 upload
- Connection pool health checks (pool_pre_ping)
- Cookie security: httpOnly, sameSite=Lax
